                <p>I am an aspiring softwear developer currently enrolled in a bootcamp through UNCC, however my intrest in code began long before this class. The summer of 2018 I began to teach my self through various resources such as codecaddemy, treehouse, freecodecamp, youtube, and so many other reandom resources. In this time I learned frustration and how google the questions I coudlnt find the answer to from my usual resources. My intrest and love for code grew more the more I learned, thats when I realized that I would need more than just the knowhow to land my dream job.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="num-2ß">As much as I love technology and web development, those aren't my only intrests. I have a great passion for cars, coffee, and music. I've spent countless hours both professionally and as hobby in all of those realms, however none have them have kept me interested the way code has in a professional capacity.</p>
