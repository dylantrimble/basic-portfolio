                <p>I am an aspiring software developer currently enrolled in a bootcamp through UNCC, however my
                    interest in code began long before this class. The summer of 2018 I began to teach my self through
                    various resources such as codecaddemy, treehouse, freecodecamp, youtube, and so many other random
                    resources. In this time I learned frustration and how to google the questions I couldn't find the
                    answer to. My interest and love for code grew the more I learned. Thats when I realized that I would
                    need more than just the knowhow to land my dream job.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="num-2">As much as I love technology and web development, those aren't my only interests. I
                    have a great passion for cars, coffee, and music. I've spent countless hours both professionally and
                    as hobby in all of those realms, however none have them have kept me interested the way code has in
                    a professional capacity. In my free time I still tinker on my car and surround my self in car
                    culture.</p>
